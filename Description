The Python application implements an algorithm to explore all possible knight moves, determining if a 
complete tour is achievable. 
The solution not only calculates the tour but also specifies whether the resulting tour is open
(if the knight cannot return to the starting square) or closed (if the knight returns to its starting square).
This project serves as a practical demonstration of algorithmic problem-solving and pathfinding in a constrained 
environment.
